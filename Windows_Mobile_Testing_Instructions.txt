*** What do I need to install in order to do Mobile Testing on Windows? ***

Documentation: For all Mobile Testing subjects we will be using Appium, and main documentation for this is here: https://appium.io/docs/en/2.1/

Important Note: For all commands you will run, use Command Prompt or Power Shell as administrator

1. At least JDK version 11 or a later version needs to be installed 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
You might already have installed JDK, to check it, open the terminal and run the command:
$ java --version 

2. Install NodeJS (latest LTS as of today) https://nodejs.org/en/
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. 

Verify installation with node -v and npm -v on the command line
 node -v  or node --version
 npm -v.  or npm --version

3. Install Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio
(Simple installation - Always Next - Do not import Settings (if it asks) - For Data Sharing Don’t Send - Install Type Standard - Finish-Choose SDK Manager)
Open Android Studio click on Configure and select AVD Manager:
Click at Create Virtual Device:
Proceed with Pixel 5 and hit Next:
Download Android 11 by clicking on Download link and following installation instructions.

For windows users you might get error installing Android Studio if your virtualization setting
is not enabled from BIOS settings.
To fix this, I will share some links and videos from youtube.

4. Install Appium Server, you need to open your Comand Line and type either:

    npm i appium -g
    npm i --location=global appium


After installing appium, now install driver:

IMPORTANT: Install UiAutomator2 Driver
Run This Command:
   
    appium driver install uiautomator2

5. Install appium-doctor, you need to open your Comand Line and type either of following 
    npm i appium-doctor -g 
    npm i --location=global appium-doctor

And execute setup verification by running following command on the terminal:
      appium-doctor
      WARN AppiumDoctor ✖ ANDROID_HOME is NOT set!
      WARN AppiumDoctor ✖ JAVA_HOME is NOT set!

      At this point appium-doctor will complain about ANDROID_HOME, JAVA_HOME environment variables 

Let's fix environment variables first. 
Setup ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME: We have short videos for this at the LMS, watch those first

6. Install Appium Inspector https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases
You can install the latest release. After installing your computer might now allow it to open.
You can open your security settings of your computer and allow it to work.

Alternatively you can use Browser Version of Appium Inspector without installing.
When you use this version IMPORTANT start your Appium Server with:
        appium --allow cors 

7. Create a Maven project
Add following to pom.xml
