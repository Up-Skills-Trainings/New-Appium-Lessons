Mobile testing is Front-End testing
Appium which is a wrapper for Selenium API
Famous because it can automate both android and ios devices
***Also testing web app and native app

** PIQ: What is emulator or simulator?
emulator is a virtual device that acts like real Android phone
simulator is a virtual device that acts like real iphone

PIQ:
UiAutomator2 Driver - ANdroid
XCUITEST Driver - IOS

[Appium] Available drivers:
[Appium]   - uiautomator2@2.29.2 (automationName 'UiAutomator2')
[Appium]   - xcuitest@7.0.1 (automationName 'XCUITest')

Appium supports multiple languages: Java, JS, Python C#
- Javascript with webdriverio test framework

Appium Have two tools that you need for automation
Appium Server -- communicates your code to the devices
Appium Client -- The dependency at your project (library)

We can test Mobile view at regular browsers developer tools
- chrome- inspect - toggle device toolbar and select different views
- important manual testing

Steps to create an Android driver for automation:
 AndroidDriver driver; - declare driver
 URL url;  - declare url for appium server
 UiAutomator2Options options = new UiAutomator2Options();
        **** Options-settings for test automation (wait, app etc.)
        try {
            url = new URL("http://localhost:4723/");
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }  ------create the URL and handle exception

        driver = new AndroidDriver(url,options); -- initialize driver with url and options objects



Task 02:
will automate a native app etsy.apk, will provide this from test directory
use singleton Driver concept


Resume:
* Selenium, Java ---tools used  , add Appium for Mobile Testing - capabilities
* What kind of testing : In your company, you automated Native App of your application on Android devices
* Why android ?  --- our mobile customers are %80 using Android
* Cucumber framework, singleton Driver, Page Object Model : framework structure for Mobile Testing
* I did manual Mobile testing with real devices that company provides
