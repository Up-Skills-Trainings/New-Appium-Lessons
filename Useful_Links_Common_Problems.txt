TERMINAL / Command Line COMMANDS USED IN THE LESSON

**** COMMON ISSUES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS *****

• To see hidden files on MacOS, press Command + Shift + . (dot)

• To check installed java version java --version or java -v
• Verify installation with node -v and npm -v or node --version
• Install Appium Server, you need to open your Terminal and type either (npm i appium -g) or
(npm i --location=global appium)
• Install UiAutomator2 Driver : “appium driver install uiautomator2”

• !!! Important Note for MacOS: To give access for node_modules you can use following command if necessary (if you get EACCESS denied error) 
- sudo chown -R yourUserName:/usr/local/lib/
Sudo is superuser can do anything.When you run this command it will ask you password 
and when you are typing your password it will be INVISIBLE.
Type it correctly and click ENTER
- Chown : Change Owner - To quit Node click Ctrl+C twice (if needed)

• Java and Android Home setup for MacOS - copy paste the following content to the .zprofile (.bash_profile for older macs):
------------
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)

export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$(whoami)/Library/Android/sdk

export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$ANDROID_HOME

export ANDROID_AVD_HOME=/Users/$(whoami)/.android/avd

export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/33.0.2:$JAVA_HOME/bin 
-----------

• To allow chrome driver install by Appium server run: `appium —allow-insecure
chromedriver_autodownload`
• To disable security for MacOS so chrome executable is allowed to run: `sudo spctl —masterdisable`. (Use with caution)
• To understand your shell environment `echo $SHELL`
/bin/bash: Indicates you are using Bash, and the configuration files may include .bashrc
and/or .bash_profile.
/bin/zsh: Indicates you are using Zsh, and the configuration file may include .zshrc.

-----------------
For windows users you might get error installing Android Studio if your virtualization setting
is not enabled from BIOS settings.
To fix this, I will share some links and videos from youtube.

appium-doctor
      WARN AppiumDoctor ✖ ANDROID_HOME is NOT set!
      WARN AppiumDoctor ✖ JAVA_HOME is NOT set!

      At this point appium-doctor will complain about ANDROID_HOME, JAVA_HOME environment variables 

Let's fix environment variables first. 
Setup ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME: We have short videos for this at the LMS, watch those first
